      <p>
        Hello my name is Armando Salinas. I have been learning and practicing
        software development for four years on my own and in school. I've done
        this out of my home town of McAllen, Texas and as I've traveled
        thoughout Central America and Mexico for a couple of years.
      </p>

      <p>
        I like to get out of my comfort zone and reap the benefits of doing so.
        Meeting new people and engaging in new endeavors isn't easy but the
        upside to this is makes it essential to a good life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Coding and solving problems is an experience that I enjoy and find very
        rewarding. I look forward to an opportunity which will allow me to
        continue to grow in this field and contribute to an organization.
      </p>
